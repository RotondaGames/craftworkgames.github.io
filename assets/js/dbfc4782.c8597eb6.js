GUM is a game UI layout tool created by Victor Chelaru ([@vchelaru](https://github.com/vchelaru)) and is used in the engine he maintains, [FlatRedBall](https://flatredball.com/). Recently, it was updated to work as a standalone tool that can be used in any MonoGame project.\\n\\nAs I review the backlog of issues in MonoGame.Extended and prepare for the library\'s future, you can probably guess where this post is heading.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncated --\x3e\\n\\n## MonoGame.Extended.GUI\\nInitially, a port of Nuclex GUI was made as a GUI solution in MonoGame.Extended. Following that, Dylan, the original creator and maintainer of MonoGame.Extended, began work on the current MonoGame.Extended.Gui library.\\n\\n![Forum Post About Nuclex](./nuclex-gui.png)\\n\\nDylan\'s original statement that **\\"It\u2019s quite a big job creating a really solid GUI system.\\"** is very true. Not only is it a big job to create one, but it\'s also a significant effort to maintain it, fix bugs, and add new features.\\n\\n## Meet GUM\\nI\'ve been keeping an eye on Vic\'s GUM Tool for a while now, and it\'s a solid tool. GUM consists of two parts: the GUM Layout Engine, which is the code framework, and the GUM Tool.\\n\\nThe GUM Tool is a WYSIWYG Editor where you can visually create the UI elements for your game.\\n\\n![GUM Tool Editor](./gum-tool-example.png)\\n\\nYou can export your creations from the editor to a format that can be loaded into MonoGame and used. Alternatively, if you prefer not to use the editor, **you don\'t have to**. GUM also supports a code-first approach to creating layouts and UI.\\n\\nI highly recommend checking it out. Here\'s the [MonoGame Setup](https://docs.flatredball.com/gum/monogame/setup) documentation page for it.\\n\\n## What Does This Mean?\\nAs I look forward to the future of MonoGame.Extended, I need to determine how best to maintain and advance the library. To quote Dylan again, **\\"It\u2019s quite a big job creating a really solid GUI system.\\"** Vic has done this with GUM and done it well.\\n\\nAfter discussing with Vic earlier today, I will begin working with him to integrate GUM into MonoGame.Extended, replacing the current MonoGame.Extended.Gui portion. This means that GUM will become the standard supported UI choice in MonoGame.Extended in the future.\\n\\n## What About MonoGame.Extended.Gui?\\n*Deleted, gone*....\\n\\nJust kidding. A lot of work has gone into MonoGame.Extended.Gui. From Dylan\'s initial efforts to the contributions from various contributors, I have great respect for the time and effort invested in it.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a significant part of MonoGame.Extended\u2019s history, and I wouldn\'t just discard the work that\'s been done. Some may still wish to use and contribute to it in the future.\\n\\nTherefore, when the time comes, MonoGame.Extended.Gui will be moved out of the main MonoGame.Extended repository into its own separate project, where it can continue to exist and be used by those who prefer it.\\n\\n## Let\'s Wrap This Up\\nIn conclusion, the focus of the UI portion of MonoGame.Extended will shift to using GUM UI. The existing MonoGame.Extended.Gui project will be moved to its own repository, where it can be maintained separately.\\n\\nIf you have a moment, I encourage you to check out [GUM](https://docs.flatredball.com/gum). It truly is an amazing tool, and I look forward to its integration into the MonoGame.Extended ecosystem.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please let me know in the comments below or on Discord. Have a great weekend, everyone.\\n\\n\\\\- Aris"},{"id":"bmfont-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/bmfont-update","editUrl":"https://github.com/craftworkgames/craftworkgames.github.io/tree/develop/blog/2024-06-13/bmfont-update/bmfont-update.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-13/bmfont-update/bmfont-update.md","title":"BitmapFont Updates","description":"BMFont support has had a small update in MonoGame.Extended.","date":"2024-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"BitmapFonts","permalink":"/blog/tags/bitmap-fonts","description":"Updates on BitmapFont Support"},{"inline":false,"label":"Version 4.0","permalink":"/blog/tags/4.0","description":"Version 4.0 Related News"}],"readingTime":0.955,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Whitley (AristurtleDev)","title":"MonoGame.Extended Maintainer","url":"https://github.com/aristurtledev","imageURL":"https://github.com/aristurtledev.png","key":"aris"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"bmfont-update","title":"BitmapFont Updates","authors":"aris","tags":["bmfont","four-oh"],"enableComments":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"MonoGame.Extended Chews GUM","permalink":"/blog/monogame-extended-gum"},"nextItem":{"title":"Update Status 2024-06-12","permalink":"/blog/update-2024-06-12"}},"content":"BMFont support has had a small update in MonoGame.Extended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- trunicated --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, MonoGame.Extended required that the `.fnt` file created by BMFont be exported as XML.

With this thought in mind, I have begun to restructure the project some, as many may have already noticed.  The reason behind this is that I feel things in Monogame.Extended should be placed in logical places that match types they are working with in MonoGame.  This keeps the source code structure similar to MonoGame which is beneficial for users working from source between both projects.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do I mean by this though?  Well, one example is the `RectangleExtensions`.  Previously it was placed in `MonoGame.Extended.Math`  However `Rectangle` in MonoGame exits in the root namespace, not in a `Math` namespace.  So `RectangleExtensions` will be moved to the project root to match the similar structure.  Some other changes, like `TextureRegion2D` is currently located in the `MonoGame.Extended.TextureAtlases` directory/namespace. At first, this seems like a logical fit, but a `TextureRegion2D` is a region of a `Texture2D`.  Atlases just use them, you don\'t have to have an atlas to use a `TextureRegion2D`.  So because they are more locally related to the `Texture2D` in MonoGame, they will be moved to a similar directory/namespace (`MonoGame.Extended.Graphic`).\\r\\n\\r\\n## In Conclusion\\r\\nI know no one like change, and changes like this may seem superfluous, but I do believe it will be a better user experience moving forward with 4.0.  However, I do value community feedback, so please give me your thoughts and feedback on this in the comment section at the end of this document.  We\'re halfway there to the 4.0.0 release."},{"id":"mongame-extended-is-back","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mongame-extended-is-back","editUrl":"https://github.com/craftworkgames/craftworkgames.github.io/tree/develop/blog/2024-06-02-mongame-extended-is-back/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-02-mongame-extended-is-back/index.md","title":"MonoGame.Extended Is Back","description":"It has been far too long since an official release was made of MonoGame.Extended.

Who is this person saying that MonoGame.Extended is back.  Well, my name is Chris Whitley, also known as Aristurtle in the MonoGame Community.  I have been working with MonoGame for several years and maintain other open source libraries for MonoGame.  I am also a contributor to the main MonoGame repository as well.\\n\\nOutside of working with MonoGame and doing game development, I am a full stack dotnet web developer.  \\n\\n## Change of Responsibility\\nThe previous maintainer, Lucas Girouard-Stranks [@lithiumtoast](https://github.com/lithiumtoast), has stepped down due to lack of time and interest in maintaining MonoGame.Extended. Moving forward, I will be taking over the [craftworkgames](https://github.com/craftworkgames) organization on GitHub.  This includes maintaining MonoGame.Extended.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this, please contact me on the [MonoGame.Extended Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FvZ8Z7EzPJ)\\n\\n## Roadmap\\nComing into MonoGame.Extended as a maintainer, the first priority is getting outstanding issues closed and a new release pushed.  This means my current attention will be focused solely on that goal for now.  New features that have been requested will be pushed back in favor of prioritizing outstanding issues.\\n\\nI currently have a goal of resolving outstanding issue by the end of June 2024. You can follow the progress of this on the [v4.0.0 Milestone](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/milestone/8) page.\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\nMonoGame.Extended would not exist were it not for the original maintainer Dylan Wilson [@dylanwilson80](https://github.com/dylanwilson80), Lucas Girouard-Stranks [@lithiumtoast](https://github.com/lithiumtoast) taking over, and the work done by countless community members over time.  Thank you everyone for all that you have done for this project in the past, and I am honored to be the person leading this into the future.  I look forward to working with you all to continue shaping this into the best extension library for MonoGame."}]}}')}}]);
