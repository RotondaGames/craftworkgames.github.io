With this thought in mind, I have begun to restructure the project some, as many may have already noticed.  The reason behind this is that I feel things in Monogame.Extended should be placed in logical places that match types they are working with in MonoGame.  This keeps the source code structure similar to MonoGame which is beneficial for users working from source between both projects.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do I mean by this though?  Well, one example is the `RectangleExtensions`.  Previously it was placed in `MonoGame.Extended.Math`  However `Rectangle` in MonoGame exits in the root namespace, not in a `Math` namespace.  So `RectangleExtensions` will be moved to the project root to match the similar structure.  Some other changes, like `TextureRegion2D` is currently located in the `MonoGame.Extended.TextureAtlases` directory/namespace. At first, this seems like a logical fit, but a `TextureRegion2D` is a region of a `Texture2D`.  Atlases just use them, you don\'t have to have an atlas to use a `TextureRegion2D`.  So because they are more locally related to the `Texture2D` in MonoGame, they will be moved to a similar directory/namespace (`MonoGame.Extended.Graphic`).\\r\\n\\r\\n## In Conclusion\\r\\nI know no one like change, and changes like this may seem superfluous, but I do believe it will be a better user experience moving forward with 4.0.  However, I do value community feedback, so please give me your thoughts and feedback on this in the comment section at the end of this document.  We\'re halfway there to the 4.0.0 release."},{"id":"mongame-extended-is-back","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mongame-extended-is-back","editUrl":"https://github.com/craftworkgames/craftworkgames.github.io/tree/develop/blog/2024-06-02-mongame-extended-is-back/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-02-mongame-extended-is-back/index.md","title":"MonoGame.Extended Is Back","description":"It has been far too long since an official release was made of MonoGame.Extended.

Who is this person saying that MonoGame.Extended is back.  Well, my name is Chris Whitley, also known as Aristurtle in the MonoGame Community.  I have been working with MonoGame for several years and maintain other open source libraries for MonoGame.  I am also a contributor to the main MonoGame repository as well.\\n\\nOutside of working with MonoGame and doing game development, I am a full stack dotnet web developer.  \\n\\n## Change of Responsibility\\nThe previous maintainer, Lucas Girouard-Stranks [@lithiumtoast](https://github.com/lithiumtoast), has stepped down due to lack of time and interest in maintaining MonoGame.Extended. Moving forward, I will be taking over the [craftworkgames](https://github.com/craftworkgames) organization on GitHub.  This includes maintaining MonoGame.Extended.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this, please contact me on the [MonoGame.Extended Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FvZ8Z7EzPJ)\\n\\n## Roadmap\\nComing into MonoGame.Extended as a maintainer, the first priority is getting outstanding issues closed and a new release pushed.  This means my current attention will be focused solely on that goal for now.  New features that have been requested will be pushed back in favor of prioritizing outstanding issues.\\n\\nI currently have a goal of resolving outstanding issue by the end of June 2024. You can follow the progress of this on the [v4.0.0 Milestone](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/milestone/8) page.\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\nMonoGame.Extended would not exist were it not for the original maintainer Dylan Wilson [@dylanwilson80](https://github.com/dylanwilson80), Lucas Girouard-Stranks [@lithiumtoast](https://github.com/lithiumtoast) taking over, and the work done by countless community members over time.  Thank you everyone for all that you have done for this project in the past, and I am honored to be the person leading this into the future.  I look forward to working with you all to continue shaping this into the best extension library for MonoGame."}]}}')}}]);
