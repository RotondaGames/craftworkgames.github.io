In C/C++, one the things object pooling has to offer is a solution to avoid memory fragmentation. In C#, we don\'t have to worry about memory fragmentation thanks to garbage collection. However, garbage collection can be still be too expensive for certain parts of real-time applications, especially on mobile devices with slower CPUs and simpler garbage collectors.
