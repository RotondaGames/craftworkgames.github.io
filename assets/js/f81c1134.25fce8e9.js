Issues have piled up on GitHub, and everyone just wants to import Tiled maps.  \\n\\nSo let\'s change that!\\n\\n\x3c!-- trunicated --\x3e\\n\\n## Hello MonoGame Community\\nBefore moving further, I want to take a moment and introduce myself.  Who is this person saying that MonoGame.Extended is back.  Well, my name is Chris Whitley, also known as Aristurtle in the MonoGame Community.  I have been working with MonoGame for several years and maintain other open source libraries for MonoGame.  I am also a contributor to the main MonoGame repository as well.\\n\\nOutside of working with MonoGame and doing game development, I am a full stack dotnet web developer.  \\n\\n## Change of Responsibility\\nThe previous maintainer, Lucas Girouard-Stranks [@lithiumtoast](https://github.com/lithiumtoast), has stepped down due to lack of time and interest in maintaining MonoGame.Extended. Moving forward, I will be taking over the [craftworkgames](https://github.com/craftworkgames) organization on GitHub.  This includes maintaining MonoGame.Extended.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns about this, please contact me on the [MonoGame.Extended Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FvZ8Z7EzPJ)\\n\\n## Roadmap\\nComing into MonoGame.Extended as a maintainer, the first priority is getting outstanding issues closed and a new release pushed.  This means my current attention will be focused solely on that goal for now.  New features that have been requested will be pushed back in favor of prioritizing outstanding issues.\\n\\nI currently have a goal of resolving outstanding issue by the end of June 2024. You can follow the progress of this on the [v4.0.0 Milestone](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/milestone/8) page.\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\nMonoGame.Extended would not exist were it not for the original maintainer Dylan Wilson [@dylanwilson80](https://github.com/dylanwilson80), Lucas Girouard-Stranks [@lithiumtoast](https://github.com/lithiumtoast) taking over, and the work done by countless community members over time.  Thank you everyone for all that you have done for this project in the past, and I am honored to be the person leading this into the future.  I look forward to working with you all to continue shaping this into the best extension library for MonoGame."}]}}')}}]);
