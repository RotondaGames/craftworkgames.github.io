        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been working hard this past month on getting a new "stable" release of <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> out.  Not only was there a backlog of issues that needed to be resolved, but the current released NuGets were not compatible with the current version of <a href="https://monogame.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MonoGame</a> (v3.8.1.303).  This made it more difficult for users to actually use <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> if they wanted to use NuGets instead of referencing directly from source.</p>
<p>So why did I put the word "stable" in quotes above?  While not all planned issues have been resolved for the new release, after talking another developer friend, I've made the decision to release version 4.0 as it is right now (thanks <a href="https://github.com/vchelaru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vic</a>).  This allows users to go ahead and start using the current version which is compatible with MonoGame 3.8.1.303 and has many bug fixes already implemented.  In the meantime, work will continue to resolve outstanding issues and feature requests and they will be pushed as patch or minor semver releases as they are finished.</p>
<p>The trade off here is more smaller but more frequent releases but consumers can roll forward with bug fixes as they get resolved.</p>
<p>So with that said, let's talk about some of the major changes that are coming in with this initial release and why these changes were made.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-single-project">A Single Project<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Single Project" title="Direct link to A Single Project" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/version-4-initial-release/#a-single-project">​</a></h2>
<p>Well, really it's two projects, <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> and <strong>MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline</strong>.  However, the decision was made to take all the individual library projects like <strong>MonoGame.Extended.Graphics</strong>, <strong>MonoGame.Extended.Input</strong>, <strong>MonoGame.Extended.Entities</strong>, etc and move them so they are just all part of <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong>.  While each of these individual projects did add specific functionality that was separate from the core project, the majority of them were really tiny projects that just added noise both on NuGet and to the number of additional libraries to install.</p>
<p>So gone are the days of installing multiple NuGets to get the full benefits of <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong>.  There is now one NuGet to rule them all (and also the content pipeline one).</p>

(thanks TurtleBaseAlpha (tigurx)).</p></div></div>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-restructure">Project Restructure<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Restructure" title="Direct link to Project Restructure" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/version-4-initial-release/#project-restructure">​</a></h2>
<p>For many, updating to v4 initially is going to give you some red squigglies.  This is because many parts of the project were restructured to mirror the base MonoGame project where it could.  For instance, things related to graphics like <code>Texture2DRegion</code>, <code>Texture2DAtlas</code>, and <code>SpriteSheet</code> were moved to the <code>MonoGame.Extended.Graphics</code> namespace.  These classes all deal with using and extending <code>Texture2D</code> so they are in a mirrored namespace.</p>
<p>For many of the errors you will have initially when updating, it will just be needing to change the namespace.  Only a small handful of things were renamed to better reflect what they are (e.g. <code>TextureRegion2D</code> was renamed to <code>Texture2DRegion</code>).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="content-pipeline-woes">Content Pipeline Woes<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Content Pipeline Woes" title="Direct link to Content Pipeline Woes" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/version-4-initial-release/#content-pipeline-woes">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the biggest headaches was using the <strong>MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline</strong> extensions and adding the dll reference in the MGCB Editor.  This isn't a problem that is unique to <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong>, all third party content pipeline extensions have to deal with this.  The problem is that the NuGets are downloaded to the global nuget cache on your PC.  So when you add the reference in the MGCB Editor, file path is stored as a relative path in the Content.mgcb file. This means that if you move your project folder, or if you are working with a team and sharing a repository, that relative path is going to break unless the project directory is always in the same place on every PC you use.</p>
<p>There have been many workarounds and suggestions on easing this for the consumer in talks between third party developers.  There is no one-solution-fits-all scenario and each workaround has its tradeoffs.  Previously <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> recommended adding a <code>nuget.config</code> file to your project to force the NuGets to download locally to your project directory, thus ensuring the relative path was always relative within the project directory.  This isn't a bad solution, but it does mean you're altering the default way NuGet is handled for that specific project, which isn't ideal if you don't want to actually do that (it affects all NuGets for the project, not just the <strong>MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline</strong> one).</p>
<p>With version 4, I have implemented a new workaround to ease this issue.  The <strong>MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline</strong> NuGet now ships with a <code>.targets</code> file.  Whenever you do a project build, this task will execute just before the actual build occurs and also before the MonoGame content task runs to build content.  The task will copy the <code>MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll</code> and its dependency assemblies to a path specified by you, the consumer, for easier referencing of the dll as well as making the relative path issue with the Content.mgcb not as brittle.</p>
<p>So how does this work?  The <a href="https://www.monogameextended.net/docs/getting-started/installation-monogame/">documentation</a> was updated with the new steps, but we'll cover it briefly here.  After adding the <strong>MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline</strong> NuGet, consumers will now need to update their project's <code>.csproj</code> file and add the following property manually</p>
<div class="language-xml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-xml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&lt;</span><span class="token tag" style="color:#00009f">PropertyGroup</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&lt;</span><span class="token tag" style="color:#00009f">MonoGameExtendedPipelineReferencePath</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain">$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)pipeline-references</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&lt;/</span><span class="token tag" style="color:#00009f">MonoGameExtendedPipelineReferencePath</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&lt;/</span><span class="token tag" style="color:#00009f">PropertyGroup</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>This new <code>MonoGameExtendedPipelineReferencePath</code> property defines the path that the task will copy the dependency dlls too.  The above snippet is the recommended default, however it was designed this way so that the consumer can choose the path instead of the library assuming the path for them.</p>
<p>If you use the content pipeline extensions, please give me any feedback on this new method, good or bad.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="MonoGame.Extended Logo In GUM Tool" src="https://www.monogameextended.net/assets/images/banner-f90f64060b95adf927ed25ee6a209420.png" width="2376" height="1570" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>If you've been active in the MonoGame Discord or other community spaces lately, you might have heard of <a href="https://docs.flatredball.com/gum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GUM</a>. GUM is a game UI layout tool created by Victor Chelaru (<a href="https://github.com/vchelaru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@vchelaru</a>) and is used in the engine he maintains, <a href="https://flatredball.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlatRedBall</a>. Recently, it was updated to work as a standalone tool that can be used in any MonoGame project.</p>
<p>As I review the backlog of issues in MonoGame.Extended and prepare for the library's future, you can probably guess where this post is heading.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="monogameextendedgui">MonoGame.Extended.GUI<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to MonoGame.Extended.GUI" title="Direct link to MonoGame.Extended.GUI" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/monogame-extended-gum/#monogameextendedgui">​</a></h2>
<p>Initially, a port of Nuclex GUI was made as a GUI solution in MonoGame.Extended. Following that, Dylan, the original creator and maintainer of MonoGame.Extended, began work on the current MonoGame.Extended.Gui library.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Forum Post About Nuclex" src="https://www.monogameextended.net/assets/images/nuclex-gui-d5a107f0795450ff5c5dd5b957e1fc6b.png" width="1864" height="698" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Dylan's original statement that <strong>"It’s quite a big job creating a really solid GUI system."</strong> is very true. Not only is it a big job to create one, but it's also a significant effort to maintain it, fix bugs, and add new features.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="meet-gum">Meet GUM<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Meet GUM" title="Direct link to Meet GUM" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/monogame-extended-gum/#meet-gum">​</a></h2>
<p>I've been keeping an eye on Vic's GUM Tool for a while now, and it's a solid tool. GUM consists of two parts: the GUM Layout Engine, which is the code framework, and the GUM Tool.</p>
<p>The GUM Tool is a WYSIWYG Editor where you can visually create the UI elements for your game.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="GUM Tool Editor" src="https://www.monogameextended.net/assets/images/gum-tool-example-092f22f27f063f13bf96221696fd5fe3.png" width="1532" height="948" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>You can export your creations from the editor to a format that can be loaded into MonoGame and used. Alternatively, if you prefer not to use the editor, <strong>you don't have to</strong>. GUM also supports a code-first approach to creating layouts and UI.</p>
<p>I highly recommend checking it out. Here's the <a href="https://docs.flatredball.com/gum/monogame/setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MonoGame Setup</a> documentation page for it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-this-mean">What Does This Mean?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Does This Mean?" title="Direct link to What Does This Mean?" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/monogame-extended-gum/#what-does-this-mean">​</a></h2>
<p>As I look forward to the future of MonoGame.Extended, I need to determine how best to maintain and advance the library. To quote Dylan again, <strong>"It’s quite a big job creating a really solid GUI system."</strong> Vic has done this with GUM and done it well.</p>
<p>After discussing with Vic earlier today, I will begin working with him to integrate GUM into MonoGame.Extended, replacing the current MonoGame.Extended.Gui portion. This means that GUM will become the standard supported UI choice in MonoGame.Extended in the future.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-monogameextendedgui">What About MonoGame.Extended.Gui?<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What About MonoGame.Extended.Gui?" title="Direct link to What About MonoGame.Extended.Gui?" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/monogame-extended-gum/#what-about-monogameextendedgui">​</a></h2>
<p><em>Deleted, gone</em>....</p>
<p>Just kidding. A lot of work has gone into MonoGame.Extended.Gui. From Dylan's initial efforts to the contributions from various contributors, I have great respect for the time and effort invested in it.</p>
<p>It’s a significant part of MonoGame.Extended’s history, and I wouldn't just discard the work that's been done. Some may still wish to use and contribute to it in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the time comes, MonoGame.Extended.Gui will be moved out of the main MonoGame.Extended repository into its own separate project, where it can continue to exist and be used by those who prefer it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-wrap-this-up">Let's Wrap This Up<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let's Wrap This Up" title="Direct link to Let's Wrap This Up" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/monogame-extended-gum/#lets-wrap-this-up">​</a></h2>
<p>In conclusion, the focus of the UI portion of MonoGame.Extended will shift to using GUM UI. The existing MonoGame.Extended.Gui project will be moved to its own repository, where it can be maintained separately.</p>
<p>If you have a moment, I encourage you to check out <a href="https://docs.flatredball.com/gum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GUM</a>. It truly is an amazing tool, and I look forward to its integration into the MonoGame.Extended ecosystem.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know in the comments below or on Discord. Have a great weekend, everyone.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/pull/887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR #887</a> all three export formats are now supported both when loading the file directly at runtime or if you want to use the Content Pipeline to preprocess the file.</p>
<p>This change is significant because it means that you can use any tool that can export a <code>.fnt</code> file in the AngleCode Bitmap Font file format, such as <a href="https://libgdx.com/wiki/tools/hiero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libGDX Hiero</a> which can be used cross platform.  Previously only the AngleCode BMFont application could be used, which was Windows only, unless you setup WINE on macOS or Linux to run it.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this is that Hiero supports exporting the fonts as Signed Distance Field, which means I can start implementing SDF Font Rendering support.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.monogameextended.net/docs/features/fonts/bitmapfont/">BitmapFont Feature</a> article has also been updated to better explain how to use the feature.</p>
<p>That's all for now, hope everyone is having a great week.</p>

<p>I wanted to take a moment and give a report on some of the progress made so far in getting version 4.0 officially released.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/milestone/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v4.0.0 Milestone</a> page, you can see we are now at 55% completed</p>

<p>A lot of the remaining issues here could be closed with better documentation, which is going to come in the last leg of this sprint. However, with the current pace, the current deadline of end of June is looking good.  If you'd like to get involved in helping resolve the backlog of issues, please do.

<p>And with that status report out of the way, I wanted to touch on some other subjects</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="repository-changes">Repository Changes<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Repository Changes" title="Direct link to Repository Changes" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/update-2024-06-12/#repository-changes">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> is an extension of <strong>MonoGame</strong>.  With this thought in mind, I have begun to restructure the project some, as many may have already noticed.  The reason behind this is that I feel things in Monogame.Extended should be placed in logical places that match types they are working with in MonoGame.  This keeps the source code structure similar to MonoGame which is beneficial for users working from source between both projects.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this though?  Well, one example is the <code>RectangleExtensions</code>.  Previously it was placed in <code>MonoGame.Extended.Math</code>  However <code>Rectangle</code> in MonoGame exits in the root namespace, not in a <code>Math</code> namespace.  So <code>RectangleExtensions</code> will be moved to the project root to match the similar structure.  Some other changes, like <code>TextureRegion2D</code> is currently located in the <code>MonoGame.Extended.TextureAtlases</code> directory/namespace. At first, this seems like a logical fit, but a <code>TextureRegion2D</code> is a region of a <code>Texture2D</code>.  Atlases just use them, you don't have to have an atlas to use a <code>TextureRegion2D</code>.  So because they are more locally related to the <code>Texture2D</code> in MonoGame, they will be moved to a similar directory/namespace (<code>MonoGame.Extended.Graphic</code>).</p>

<p>I know no one like change, and changes like this may seem superfluous, but I do believe it will be a better user experience moving forward with 4.0.  However, I do value community feedback, so please give me your thoughts and feedback on this in the comment section at the end of this document.  We're halfway there to the 4.0.0 release.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been far too long since an official release was made of MonoGame.Extended.  Issues have piled up on GitHub, and everyone just wants to import Tiled maps.</p>
<p>So let's change that!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hello-monogame-community">Hello MonoGame Community<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hello MonoGame Community" title="Direct link to Hello MonoGame Community" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/mongame-extended-is-back/#hello-monogame-community">​</a></h2>
<p>Before moving further, I want to take a moment and introduce myself.  Who is this person saying that MonoGame.Extended is back.  Well, my name is Chris Whitley, also known as Aristurtle in the MonoGame Community.  I have been working with MonoGame for several years and maintain other open source libraries for MonoGame.  I am also a contributor to the main MonoGame repository as well.</p>
<p>Outside of working with MonoGame and doing game development, I am a full stack dotnet web developer.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="change-of-responsibility">Change of Responsibility<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Change of Responsibility" title="Direct link to Change of Responsibility" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/mongame-extended-is-back/#change-of-responsibility">​</a></h2>
<p>The previous maintainer, Lucas Girouard-Stranks <a href="https://github.com/lithiumtoast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@lithiumtoast</a>, has stepped down due to lack of time and interest in maintaining MonoGame.Extended. Moving forward, I will be taking over the <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">craftworkgames</a> organization on GitHub.  This includes maintaining MonoGame.Extended.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this, please contact me on the <a href="https://discord.gg/FvZ8Z7EzPJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MonoGame.Extended Discord Server</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="roadmap">Roadmap<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Roadmap" title="Direct link to Roadmap" href="https://www.monogameextended.net/blog/mongame-extended-is-back/#roadmap">​</a></h2>
<p>Coming into MonoGame.Extended as a maintainer, the first priority is getting outstanding issues closed and a new release pushed.  This means my current attention will be focused solely on that goal for now.  New features that have been requested will be pushed back in favor of prioritizing outstanding issues.</p>
<p>I currently have a goal of resolving outstanding issue by the end of June 2024. You can follow the progress of this on the <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/milestone/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v4.0.0 Milestone</a> page.</p>

<p>MonoGame.Extended would not exist were it not for the original maintainer Dylan Wilson <a href="https://github.com/dylanwilson80" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dylanwilson80</a>, Lucas Girouard-Stranks <a href="https://github.com/lithiumtoast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@lithiumtoast</a> taking over, and the work done by countless community members over time.  Thank you everyone for all that you have done for this project in the past, and I am honored to be the person leading this into the future.  I look forward to working with you all to continue shaping this into the best extension library for MonoGame.</p>]]></content>
