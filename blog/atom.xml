        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been far too long since an official release was made of MonoGame.Extended.  Issues have piled up on GitHub, and everyone just wants to import Tiled maps.</p>
<p>So let's change that!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hello-monogame-community">Hello MonoGame Community<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hello MonoGame Community" title="Direct link to Hello MonoGame Community" href="https://monogameextended.net/blog/mongame-extended-is-back#hello-monogame-community">​</a></h2>
<p>Before moving further, I want to take a moment and introduce myself.  Who is this person saying that MonoGame.Extended is back.  Well, my name is Chris Whitley, also known as Aristurtle in the MonoGame Community.  I have been working with MonoGame for several years and maintain other open source libraries for MonoGame.  I am also a contributor to the main MonoGame repository as well.</p>
<p>Outside of working with MonoGame and doing game development, I am a full stack dotnet web developer.</p>

<p>The previous maintainer, Lucas Girouard-Stranks <a href="https://github.com/lithiumtoast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@lithiumtoast</a>, has stepped down due to lack of time and interest in maintaining MonoGame.Extended. Moving forward, I will be taking over the <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">craftworkgames</a> organization on GitHub.  This includes maintaining MonoGame.Extended.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this, please contact me on the <a href="https://discord.gg/FvZ8Z7EzPJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MonoGame.Extended Discord Server</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="roadmap">Roadmap<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Roadmap" title="Direct link to Roadmap" href="https://monogameextended.net/blog/mongame-extended-is-back#roadmap">​</a></h2>
<p>Coming into MonoGame.Extended as a maintainer, the first priority is getting outstanding issues closed and a new release pushed.  This means my current attention will be focused solely on that goal for now.  New features that have been requested will be pushed back in favor of prioritizing outstanding issues.</p>
<p>I currently have a goal of resolving outstanding issue by the end of June 2024. You can follow the progress of this on the <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/milestone/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v4.0.0 Milestone</a> page.</p>

<p>MonoGame.Extended would not exist were it not for the original maintainer Dylan Wilson <a href="https://github.com/dylanwilson80" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dylanwilson80</a>, Lucas Girouard-Stranks <a href="https://github.com/lithiumtoast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@lithiumtoast</a> taking over, and the work done by countless community members over time.  Thank you everyone for all that you have done for this project in the past, and I am honored to be the person leading this into the future.  I look forward to working with you all to continue shaping this into the best extension library for MonoGame.</p>]]></content>
